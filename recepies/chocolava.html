    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate lava cake, often called choco lava cake, is a decadent dessert with a rich, molten chocolate center that flows out when you cut into it. 
        The recipe is surprisingly simple: melt butter with bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, then whisk in sugar, eggs, and a touch of vanilla before folding in flour. 
        The batter is poured into greased ramekins or custard cups and baked at high heat for about 12–14 minutes—just enough for the edges to set while the center stays gooey.
         Once baked, the cakes are inverted onto plates and served warm, often with vanilla ice cream or fresh berries for contrast
        </p>

      <p>The beauty of this dessert lies in its balance of textures: a firm, cake-like exterior encasing a silky molten core.
         Variations include adding instant coffee for depth, dusting ramekins with cocoa powder for easy release, or even making eggless versions using cocoa powder and baking soda
