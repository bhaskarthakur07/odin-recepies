<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Spring rolls are a popular appetizer across East and Southeast Asia, especially in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines. 
    They are made by wrapping a thin pastry sheet around a filling, which typically consists of fresh vegetables, sometimes combined with meat like pork or shrimp</p>
    <p>The rolls can be served fresh (uncooked) or fried until crispy, depending on the regional style. 
        Traditionally, they were prepared during the spring season or Spring Festival, using the first harvest of fresh vegetables after winter, which is how they got their name</p>
